1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

I did not really find this exercise to be challenging since I have been playing around with javascript and html for years. This project was
more of a refresher assignment to put myself back into web design. Since I started university, it has been much harder to experiment with
things i am interested in, especially, when they overlap my already full schedule this semester.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

As with everything, I cannot say I am currently an expert at web development, so there are a lot of questions that I have. However, since
this exercise was more introdocutory and everything was described and explained very well'

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

If I had a few more hours, I would probably play around more with the music settings and add images that pop up whenever a button is clicked.
I would also make the lose counter higher than just one, making the game a bit easier. Another thing I would change would be a randomizer to
make the pattern more random.
